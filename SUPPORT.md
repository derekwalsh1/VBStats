## Common Questions

### How do I edit a team name?
Long-press on a team tile and select edit, or tap the edit icon when viewing the team's matches.

### How do I delete a match?
Long-press on a match tile and confirm deletion. This will delete all sets and rallies in that match.

### How do I back up my data?
1. From the team matches screen, tap the menu (⋮) in the app bar
2. Select "Export Matches"
3. Choose where to save the JSON file
4. Keep this file safe as your backup

### How do I restore data?
1. From the team matches screen, tap the menu (⋮) in the app bar
2. Select "Import Matches"
3. Choose your previously exported JSON file
4. Data will be imported into the current team

### Can I use this offline?
Yes! Ace Your Stats works completely offline. All data is stored on your device.

### Does this sync between devices?
No, Ace Your Stats stores data locally on each device. Use the export/import feature to transfer data between devices.

## Troubleshooting

### App crashes or freezes
1. Close and restart the app
2. If the problem persists, try restarting your device
3. Export your data before uninstalling/reinstalling if needed

### Lost data after update
Data should persist through updates. If data appears missing, check if you're looking at the correct team.

### Export/Import not working
- Ensure you have storage permissions enabled
- Check that you have enough free space on your device
- Make sure the JSON file format hasn't been manually edited

### Rotation tracking seems wrong
The app automatically tracks rotations based on who wins each rally. If you need to start over, you can delete the set and create a new one with the correct starting rotation.
